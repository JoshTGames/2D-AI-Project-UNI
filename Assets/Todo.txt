To do:

TODAY:

- Decorate world

BOXING DAY (25-26/12/22):
- Optimisation (Sensors dont run and only certain behaviours run when outside camera view)
- A* pathfinding to characters



- Grouped behaviours - E.g. Patrolling, Skittish (Agents will be grouped and whenever an event occurs, it will be sent to the other agents through the use of events)
- Switching between patrolling and wandering? E.g. Characters will leave the camp after wandering and enter a patrol state, they will then finish their patrol, go back to the camp and enter wandering state again.
